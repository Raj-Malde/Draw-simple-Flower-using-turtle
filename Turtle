Turtle is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around. Turtle is a beginner-friendly way to learn Python by running some basic commands and viewing the turtle do it graphically. It is like a drawing board that allows you to draw over it. The turtle module can be used in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways.
To draw, Python turtle provides many functions and methods i.e. forward, backward, etc. Some commonly used methods are:
 

forward(x): moves the pen in the forward direction by x unit. 
 
backward(x): moves the pen in the backward direction by x unit. 
 
right(x): rotate the pen in the clockwise direction by an angle x. 
 
left(x): rotate the pen in the anticlockwise direction by an angle x. 
 
penup(): stop drawing of the turtle pen. 
 
pendown(): start drawing of the turtle pen.
